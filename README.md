# Readme

In this project we are building a markdown note taking app using electron and react.

The idea is to make a note taking app that avoids locking the user to a certain tool by saving notes in plain text files instead of propriatary formats. This also allows the user to use tools like git to version control their notes in a easy way.

## Getting started

1. Install yarn `npm i -g yarn`
1. Install dependencies `yarn`
1. Start dev server `yarn dev`
